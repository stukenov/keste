## 🎯 What is Keste?

Keste is a **desktop spreadsheet editor** that uses SQLite as its storage format instead of traditional XLSX files. Think Google Sheets, but:
- ✅ **100% offline** - Your data never leaves your device
- ✅ **SQLite-powered** - Blazing fast performance with database efficiency
- ✅ **Privacy-first** - No tracking, no cloud, no data collection
- ✅ **Cross-platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Why SQLite for spreadsheets?

- **Performance**: Query and filter millions of rows instantly
- **Reliability**: ACID-compliant transactions ensure data integrity
- **Efficiency**: Compact storage with built-in compression
- **Flexibility**: Direct SQL access to your spreadsheet data
- **Standard**: Widely supported, battle-tested database format

## 💡 Why Keste

Most spreadsheets lock your data inside an opaque binary file. Keste makes the **file format itself a database**: every `.kst` file is just a SQLite database with tables for sheets, cells, formulas, and styles (see [File Format](#-file-format) below).

That unlocks a few things you can't easily do with `.xlsx`:

- **SQL-native** — open any `.kst` file with the standard `sqlite3` CLI or any SQLite client and query your spreadsheet with plain SQL. No proprietary parser required.
- **Scriptable & portable** — a single self-contained file you can version, diff, back up, and pipe through your own tooling.
- **LLM-friendly** — because the schema is transparent SQL, it's easy for AI agents and scripts to read, reason about, and transform spreadsheet data programmatically.
- **Local-first** — runs entirely on your machine with no cloud, no telemetry, and no account.

The result is a bridge between **spreadsheets** (for editing) and **SQL** (for analytics and automation) — ideal for local analytics and AI workflows.

## 🗂️ File Format

### `.kst` Format (Keste Native)

Keste uses SQLite as its native file format. Each `.kst` file is a valid SQLite database containing:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `workbook` | Workbook metadata |
| `sheet` | Sheet information |
| `cell` | Cell data (values, formulas, types) |
| `shared_string` | Shared string pool |
| `numfmt` | Number format definitions |
| `style` | Cell styles and formatting |
| `merged_range` | Merged cell ranges |
| `row_prop` | Row properties |
| `col_prop` | Column properties |
| `defined_name` | Named ranges |
| `sheet_view` | View settings (freeze panes, etc.) |

**Benefits**:
- Query your spreadsheet with SQL
- Compact and efficient storage
- ACID-compliant data integrity
- Direct database access when needed
